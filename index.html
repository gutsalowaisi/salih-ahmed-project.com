    <p><a href="">!winter!</a> Winter season is the coldest phase of the year, starts from December and ends in March. It feels very cold everywhere all through the winter season. Atmospheric temperature falls very down especially during the peak winter months. Hilly regions (including houses, trees and grasses) gets covered by the thick layer of white snow and looks very beautiful. In this season, hilly regions looks like an awesome scenery. Due to the severe cold weather conditions in the winter, people have to face lots of difficulties while going out of their homes.

    <p>Winter season is very cold and one of the four seasons of India. It falls in the month of December and ends in march during Holi festival. December and January are considered as the peak cold months of the winter season. It comes after the autumn season and finishes before the spring season (later summer season). We generally feel slight decrease in the atmospheric temperature from Diwali festival (start of winter) till Holi festival (end of winter).

        We have to face high degree cold and high speed cold winds during the peak winter months. We feel a huge level changes in the atmospheric temperature and day and night routine. In the winter season, night becomes long and day becomes short. Sky often looks clear however sometimes it remains unclear all through the day because of the thick fog during peak cold months. Sometimes it rains also during the winter season and makes condition more worse.</p>
